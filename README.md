# SC_Evictions Project 

This project is based on the evictions data from south Carolina 

I wanted to do more work on it but because "usethis" package wasnt installed on my machine everything failed 
    for many hours 
    there is no stackoverflow help for the dcl package 
    because we all signed an NDA 
    
    So i couldn't scream into the void about how sad this made me. But it made me sad 
    and unproductive
